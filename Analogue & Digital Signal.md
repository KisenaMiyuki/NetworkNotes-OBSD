## Analogue Signal
> 课件上的定义：==continuous== signal as the change in signal value occurs by ==moving through all possible intermediate values==

## Digital Signal
> 课件上的定义：a fixed set of valid levels such that each change in signal value consists of an instantaneous move from one valid level to another
